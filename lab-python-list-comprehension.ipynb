    "1. Review your code from the previous exercise and identify areas where you can apply comprehension to simplify and streamline your code. \n",

    "    - *Hint: Apply it to initialize inventory, updating the inventory and printing the updated inventory.*\n",

    "3. Add a new function to calculate the total price of the customer order. For each product in customer_orders, prompt the user to enter the price of that product. Use comprehension to calculate the total price. Note: assume that the user can only have 1 unit of each product.\n",
